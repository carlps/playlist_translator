TODO:
everything

desired functionality:
$ playlist-translate
>> from (1 apple, 2 google, 3 spotify): 1
>> to (1 apple, 2 google, 3 spotify): 2
>> enter apple music playlist ID: asdf123
>> enter apple music api key: $APPLEMUSIC
>> enter google play music api key: $GOOGLEPLAYMUSIC
...
your new google play playlist is available at https://play.google.com/asdf123


It should also be usable with cli args like
$ playlist-translate --from apple --to google --id asdf123

maybe automatically look up those env variables
and then ask for the keys if not exists


I need a Playlist object with a defined structure and I can create when I pull from web
and also can have a create_on_service() method that will do the creation.
This will require figuring out what is available and necessary from each service.
